## Personal Learnings
* Working with Angular 2 is relatively new to me. It was a little overwhelming with the new terminology but the more I worked with it, the more comfortable I became with this framework.

* Creating and validating forms is much easier than using strictly Javascript or JQuery. I hope to use Angular 2 in future projects.

* The value of plugins and tools can be very helpful in identifying underlying issues in code or assist in making a website consistent across many browsers. The use of console.log and reviewing the error messages were especially helpful in troubleshooting.

* Visual Studio Code is a lot more functional than my previous code editor (Atom), especially for a Windows user. Only function I miss is the preview feature for markdowns on Atom.

## Usage

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-rc.0.

Listed below are the instructions used to develop this application.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build
